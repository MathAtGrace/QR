<p>There are several websites that keep a running total of the national debt. One of them is <a class="external" href="https://www.usdebtclock.org/" target="_blank">USDebtClock.org</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-120-hidden.html" title="Footnote 120"><sup> 120 </sup></a>. This one also shows the population, debt per citizen and debt per taxpayer. It shows the spending and deficit with counters that are constantly moving. At the bottom you can also see the debt to GDP ratio compared with previous ratios. The rest of the website shows statistics like the GDP, income tax revenue, median income, unemployment and much more. You can also see statistics for other states and countries.</p>
