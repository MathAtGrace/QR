    <title>What is a Function?</title>
    <p>
      The mathematical concept of a function can be extremely complicated.
      It took thousands of years to come up with it,
      define it and formalize it.
      For example, just look at this definition from
      <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)">Wikipedia</url>
      (do not spend too much time on it.)
    </p>

    <p>
      You could spend your whole life learning about what a function is and never get to the rest of this book!
      For this reason we will keep things simple and informal in order to attain a quick and accessible understanding of topics,
      including functions.
      Students continuing in mathematics will add to their knowledge of functions as needed and as part of a life-long process.
    </p>

    <p>
      Start by remembering this: one input, one output.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <term>function</term>
          <idx><h>function</h></idx>
      is a rule that takes a piece of <q>usable</q>
      information that you choose (input) and gives you some kind of result
      (output).
      By <q>usable</q> we mean information that has meaning for the function.
    </p>

    <p>
      Think of a function as a sort of machine.
      Using some input,
      the machine does something to the input and then out pops a result.
      In this course our inputs will be mostly numbers and the process will yield numbers as results.

              To graphically find these answers,
              visualize arrows and guidelines on the graph.
              To find the Celsius equivalent of <m>77</m> degrees Fahrenheit,
              recognize that <m>77</m> is an input value,
              and so you must identify it on the horizontal axis.
              From there, move up, then left to the vertical axis,
              where you land at about <m>25</m> degrees Celsius.
              So <m>77 \text{degrees Fahrenheit} \approx25 \text{degrees Celsius}</m>.
            </p>

            <image pg-name="$gr[1]"/>

            <p>
              A similar process in reverse is used to determine the Fahrenheit temperature equivalent of <m>-22</m> degrees Celsius.
              Recognize that <m>-22</m> is an output,
              and so you must identify it on the vertical axis.
              From there, move left, then up to the horizontal axis,
              where you land at about <m>-8</m> degrees Fahrenheit.
              So the answer is <m>F\approx-8</m>.

          The first two are shown as ordered pairs.  If you recognize that 77 is an input value and -20 is an output value, then you can see that <m>77 \text{degrees Fahrenheit} = 25 \text{degrees Celsius}</m> and <m>-4 \text{degrees Fahrenheit} = -20 \text{degrees Celsius}</m>.

        <p>
          For the last two, you must pay attention to the horizontal and vertical axes.  Recognize that the tick-marks go by 2's, so

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            How do we communicate that we have a function?
            There has to be a simple or quick way to communicate we have a function.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            What kinds of inputs can the function use?
            The temperature function in the previous exercise could only accept temperatures between <m>-60</m> and <m>110</m> degrees Fahrenheit.
            The input of <m>150</m> degrees <m>F</m> is not usable because it is not available to choose.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            What are the possible output temperatures in degrees Celsius?
            Is any temperature possible or is there a window of reasonable temperature expectations?
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            How are the two temperature units related?
            If you increase degrees F, does the temperature in degrees <m>C</m> also increase?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      We start with notation.
      We don't want to keep writing the word, F U N C T I O N, all the time.
      That's just way too many letters.
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection>
    <title>Math as a Language</title>
    <p>
      Math is just another language.
      We use it to communicate measurements,
      changes in value and how things are related to or affect one another.
      Almost everything you say or describe in Math,
      you can say or describe in English.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this next exercise we learn to communicate the position of a train as time passes and develop the notation to express where the train is at different times.
      We will assume that this train runs on time,
      every day and the conditions every day are the same.
      You know, an alternate universe called <q>example land</q>.

              Notice that the train's distance, in miles,

              Without knowing anything about function notation,
              you can still use a language you already know, English,
              to describe information about the train.
            </p>

            <p>
              For instance:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    The train can only be in one place at any particular time.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    As time passes the train gets farther from downtown.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    The speed of the train changes during its trip.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              There are also some characteristics of the graph itself you can also describe in English:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    The graph rises as we read it from left to right.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    Sometimes the graph is curved upwards.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    Sometimes the graph curves downwards.
                  </p>

                <li>
                  <p>

      <statement>
        Consider the graph below. The dot on the graph represents the position of a train at a particular time. The cross-hairs represent the time. Notice that the train’s distance, in miles, from downtown depends on the time, in hours, after 8 a.m.
        <sidebyside width="80%">
          <image source="models/train.png"/>
        </sidebyside>
        How far from downtown is the train at 10 a.m.?
      </statement>
      <solution>
        Since 10 a.m. is 8 a.m. + 2 hours, and we have the point (2,30) labelled on the graph, we see that the train is 30 miles from downtown at 10am.
      </solution>
    </exercise>

    <p>
      In English you can communicate information about time and position in a simple sentence like
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <m>2</m> hours after <m>8</m> <init>a.m.</init> the train is <m>30</m> miles from downtown.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Here is what that same sentence looks like in Spanish.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <m>2</m> horas despues de las 8 de la mañana el tren esta 30 millas lejos del centro.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Here is what that same sentence could look like in <q>math</q>.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <m>f(2) = 30</m>
      </p>

    <title>The Grammar of Function Notation</title>
    <p>
      The math <q>sentence</q> above is actually an equation and it uses
      <term>function notation</term>
          <idx><h>function</h><h>notation</h></idx>
          <idx><h>notation</h><h>for functions</h></idx>
      to express the information about the train's position at a particular time.
    </p>

    <p>
      In math we don't really have subjects or verbs or objects.
      Instead we have input values (numbers) and we have output values.
      The function is the <q>machine</q>
      or the rule that tells us how to use the input to make an output.
    </p>

    <p>
          <idx><h>variable</h></idx><term>Variables</term> are used to represent values we don't know or that may change.
      For a function, the input is called the
      <term>independent variable</term>,
      and the output is called the <term>dependent variable</term>.
      This is because the output depends on the input.
    </p>

    <p>
      The distance from downtown is constantly changing with time,
      so we can let the dependent variable <m>D</m> represent the
      <q>Train's distance in miles from downtown</q>.
      Similarly, we can use the independent variable <m>t</m> to represent the
      <q>number of hours after <m>8</m> <init>a.m.</init></q>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Typically, we use variables that have something to do with the context of the problem,
      but sometimes we generalize an expression or equation with <m>x</m>'s and <m>y</m>'s when we have nothing specific in mind.
    </p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Variables have units</title>
      <p>
        If the variables represent actual things or events,
        we must define them to include the <term>units</term>
            <idx><h>units</h></idx>
        we used to measure the event.
        This allows us to extract meaning from the values or expressions.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you know Spanish you can <em>interpret</em>
        the meaning of a Spanish article you read by translating it into English.
        Likewise, if you know <q>math</q>,
        you can interpret the meaning of function notation by translating it into English,
        provided you know what the variables in the notation mean or what they are measuring.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          If <m>D</m> represents distance,
          you must define the units in which the distance is measured:
          miles, inches, centimeters, light years, etc.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          If <m>t</m> represents time,
          will it be measured with units of seconds, hours or years?
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>
      Since the position of the train depends on the amount of time that has passed,
      we say <q>the distance depends on time</q>.
      More specifically,
      we say that the distance of the train from downtown is a
      <term>function of time</term>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Function notation allows us to communicate that distance is a function of time by simply writing <m>D = f(t)</m>.
      The notation <m>f(t)</m> is read as,
      <q><m>f</m> of <m>t</m></q>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Remember <m>t</m> is a value.
      The function uses <m>t</m> to create the value <m>D</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, don't confuse the notation with multiplication!
      The expression <m>f(t)</m> does <alert>not</alert> mean <m>f</m> times <m>t</m>.
    </p>

    <note>
      <p>
        The word <q>function</q> usually refers to the actual <em>rule</em>
        which turns the input into the output.
        Sometimes, however,
        we will use it to describe the output of the relationship.
      </p>

    <p>
      Function notation like <m>f(t)</m> or <m>f(x)</m> or
      <m>f(\text{anything})</m> implies there is some kind of relation,
      some kind of rule,
      that takes a piece of information and returns a response or result.
      The format of function notation works on the basic principle of input and output and we often use the notation when we refer to things we don't yet know.
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance, if you work as a health assistant,
      you probably earn some hourly salary and you probably work some number of hours each week.
      I have no idea how many hours a week you work and no idea how much you earn.
      But I do know your weekly salary is related to the number of hours you work.
      In fact, your weekly salary is a function of the number of hours you work.
    </p>

    <p>
      If <m>t</m> is the number of hours you work and <m>S</m> is your weekly salary, I can use function notation to say <m>S = f(t)</m>,
      where <m>f</m> is the function,
      the instructions, that calculates your weekly salary.
      If you work <m>12</m> hours, then <m>t = 12</m>,
      so <m>f(12)</m> is your weekly salary for working <m>12</m> hours.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice I still don't know what the salary actually is,
      but I can use function notation to talk about it.
      The expression <m>f(12)</m> literally means,
      <q>whatever you earn when you work <m>12</m> hours.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      In our train example we chose some input,
      a time, and the function gave us an output of distance.
      The notation tells the reader what the input is by showing it in the parentheses:
      <me>
        f(\text{input}) = \mathit{output}
      </me>
      The function notation <m>f(0)</m> is telling us the input is <m>0</m>.
      That means, <q><m>0</m> hours after <m>8</m> <init>a.m.</init></q> In other words,
      it's <m>8</m> <init>a.m.</init>
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, <m>f(0)</m> represents an output.
      It is <q>the train's distance from downtown,
      <m>0</m> hours after <m>8</m> <init>a.m.</init></q>
      But we don't know what that distance actually is yet.
      In this case, the notation <m>f(0)</m> means
      <q>Whatever the distance is at t = 0</q>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nonetheless,
      the input and output create an <term>ordered pair</term>
          <idx><h>ordered pair</h></idx>
      <m>(0, f(0))</m>.
      On a graph the ordered pair is a <term>point</term>.
          <idx><h>point</h></idx>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        In this activity we introduce the Greek letter <m>\Delta</m> that represents change,
        and we develop the concept of <term>average rate of change</term>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The prerequisites for this lesson are knowing how to calculate the slope of a line and understanding the meaning of slope.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's start by realizing you already understand the concept of average rate of change,
        but maybe you have never heard the phrase before.

    <p>
      It turns out, <term>average rate of change</term>
      is just another way to talk about slope.
      As the name implies, it measures how quickly things change,
      on average.
    </p>

    <p>
      Common examples of average rate of change:
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Traveling from Portland, OR to Seattle, WA
            (about <m>200</m> miles)
            in <m>4</m> hours is an average speed of
            <quantity>
              <mag>50</mag><unit base="mileperhour" />
            </quantity>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Pressure at the surface of the ocean is about
            <quantity>
              <mag>14.6</mag><unit base="poundpersquareinch" />
            </quantity>
            (pounds per square inch).
            If you dive under water <m>20</m> feet the pressure is about
            <quantity>
              <mag>23.6</mag><unit base="poundpersquareinch" />
            </quantity>.
            That's an average rate of pressure increase of about
            <quantity>
              <mag>0.45</mag><unit base="poundpersquareinch" />
            </quantity>
            pounds per square inch, per foot underwater.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Earning <m>\$108</m> for <m>6</m> hours of work is an average hourly pay rate of <m>18</m> dollars per hour.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      In each example there is a function that relates an input with an output.
      When the input changes by some amount,
      the output will also change
      (though usually by some other amount).
    </p>

    <p>
      The change in the output divided by the change in the input is called an
      <term>average rate of change</term>
          <idx><h>average rate of change</h></idx>
      of the function.
    </p>

    <p>
      Be careful to remember that we are only talking about an <em>average</em>.
      For instance,
      no one can drive from Portland to Seattle at a constant speed.
      There is always stop and go traffic,
      variations in speed limits, etc.

    <p>
      In math we use the Greek letter <m>\Delta</m> to mean <q>change in</q>.
      Change between two values is typically measured by subtracting an old value from a new value.
    </p>

    <p>
      In our train story where <m>D = f(t)</m>,
      the expression <m>\Delta f</m> means
      <q>change in miles from downtown</q>.
      As the train travels away from downtown,
      the distance from downtown increases.
      New distance is greater than old distance,
      so traveling away from downtown is a positive change in distance.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the distance from downtown decreases as the train travels towards downtown.
      New distance is less than old distance,
      therefore traveling toward downtown is a negative change in distance.

    <title>Computing Average Rate of Change</title>
    <p>
      As we move from one point to another point on a function,
      there are two changes that take place:
      The change in the input is called <m>\Delta\text{Input}</m>,
      and the change in the output is called <m>\Delta\text{Output}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we divide these two changes we get an
      <term>average rate of change</term>.
    </p>

    <p>
      An average rate of change <m>=\frac{\Delta Output}{\Delta Input}</m>.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The function below shows a <em>Demand Curve</em>,
          which shows the relationship between the <em>price</em>
          at which an item is sold,
          and the <em>number</em> of items people will buy at that price.
          When the price is low,
          people will buy more of them <mdash /> when the price is high,
          people won't buy as many.

            The labeled slope triangle indicates that when the price of the item increases from <m>\$2</m> to <m>\$5</m>,
            the number sold will decrease from <m>2.5</m> thousand to <m>1.5</m> thousand.
            The average rate of change of <em>thousands sold</em>
            with respect to <em>price in dollars</em> is:
            <me>
              \frac{-1000}{3} \approx -333.33 \frac{\text{sold}}{\text{\$}}
            </me>.

    <p>
      Does this look familiar?
      Think <q>rise over run</q>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once again, average rate of change is just slope.
      You should be very familiar with the concept of slope,
      especially as it relates to lines and the famous equation
      <me>
        y = mx + b
      </me>
      where <m>m</m> represents the slope of the line.
      Now we are going to use our newly learned function notation to write slope in a different way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Remember, the notation <m>f(3)</m> represents an output value;
      it's a number.
      It's the output when the input is <m>3</m>.

      As demonstrated in the previous exercise,
      the average rate of change of a function depends on what interval (section) of the input axis we use.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a practical example,
      consider the average daily temperature in Portland as a function of the month.
      Temperatures tend to climb as winter transitions into summer (a positive average rate of change),
      while temperatures tend to drop as summer transitions back into winter (a negative rate of change).

              To find an average rate of change of any function where,

              (two points).
              Use each input to find its corresponding output.
              That makes one ordered pair.

            <p>

            <p>
              Calculate the change in the output

              Given ordered pairs <m>(a,f(a))</m> and

      <q>Does it matter what order we evaluate

    <p>
      To answer this question recall earlier you used
      <m>f(x) = (x-2)(x+3)</m> to calculate <m>f(0)</m> and <m>f(-2)</m>.
      Use these values to calculate the average rate of change in two different directions.

              Previously you were given the function <m>f(x) = (x-2)(x+3)</m> and you calculated
              <m>f(0) = -6</m> and <m>f(-2) = -4</m>.
              Use these values to calculate the average rate of change of the function in two different directions.

          <solution>
            <p>
              It does not matter what direction you calculate an average rate of change.
              Just keep the ordered pairs vertically aligned!

      The only thing that matters is that the ordered pairs are kept together.
      In the previous exercise the ordered pairs were
      <m>(0, f(0))</m> and <m>(-2,f(-2))</m>.
      If you choose to start with <m>x = 0</m> in the denominator then you must start with <m>f(0)</m> in the numerator.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand,
      if you choose to start with <m>x = -2</m> in the denominator then you must start with <m>f(-2)</m> in the numerator.
      We say that the ordered pairs <em>must be vertically aligned</em>.
    </p>

      Let's finish this activity by going back to the train example where the distance (miles) of the train from downtown is a function of the time (hours) after 8 a.m.
      In other words <m>D = f(t)</m>.

              The train changes position over time,
              therefore the train is moving and so the train has <em>speed</em>.
              Speed is a rate of change.
            </p>

            <p>
              In order to calculate an average speed for the train we need to determine how much distance the train covered
              <m>(\Delta f)</m> and how much time it took to cover that distance <m>(\Delta t)</m>.
              Consider the interval <m>1.5 \leq t \leq 2.0</m>.

            products to sell. The amount of money the manufacturer makes from

            on the materials. At the same time, however, the price of materials
            changes throughout the year.

            Arizona Cardinals running back LaRod Stephens-Howling once returned
            a kick-off to make a <m>102</m>-yard touchdown against the Oakland Raiders.
            The ball was kicked from the <m>30</m>-yard line, and it was caught
            <m>2</m> yards into the end zone. Watching the YouTube video of the kick-off,
            I approximated the angle at which the ball was kicked and, with the
            help of the internet and an old physics book, I determined the path
            of the ball could be modeled using the formula
            <me>f(x)=\frac{-1}{256}x^2+\frac{216}{256}x</me> where <m>x</m> is the
            horizontal distance of the ball (measured in feet) away from where
            the ball was kicked, and <m>f(x)</m> is its height above the ground
            (measured in feet).

    <title>Four Representations of a Relationship</title>
    <p>
      In 2002, the poverty rate of each state in the United States of America (plus D.C. and Puerto Rico) were recorded, as well as the number of births performed by teenage mothers ages 15-17.  The data is plotted below, along with a trend line of best fit.
    </p>
    <image source="teen_preg.jpg" width="95%"/>
    <p>
      The units for the <m>x</m>-axis are people below the poverty line per 100 people in each state or territory.  The <m>y</m>-axis is measured in births per 1000 girls ages 15-17 for each state or territory.  
    </p>
    <p>
      A <em>graph</em> provides a visual representation of the situation. It helps you see how the variables are related to each other and make predictions about future values or values in between those in your table. The horizontal and vertical axis of the graph should be labeled, including units.
    </p>
    <p>
      The equation for the red line is
    </p>
    <me>T = 1.3733 \times P + 4.2673</me>
    <p>
      This is an <em>equation for a model</em>.  This equation is useful because it can be used to calculate the expected teen pregnancy rate given a state's poverty rate.  Equations are useful for communicating complex relationships. In writing equations, it is always important to define what the variables represent, including units.  For example, in the equation above, <m>T </m> is in births per 1000 girls ages 15-17,  and <m>P</m> is in people living in a household below the poverty line per 100 people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way that you could have represented this relationship is in a <em>table</em> that shows values of t and B as ordered pairs. An ordered pair is two values that are matched together in a given relationship.  You used a table in the last lesson.  Tables are helpful for recognizing patterns and general relationships or for giving information about specific values. A table should always have labels for each column. The labels should include units when appropriate.

      A <em>verbal</em> description explains the relationship in words.  In this case, we can do that by looking at how the values in the formula affect the result.  According to our model, we would expect a state with no poverty to have a pregancy rate among 1000 girls 15-17 at about 4.2673.  And for any state whose poverty rate increases by 1 person per 100, the pregnancy rate for 1000 girls ages 15-17 is expected to go up 1.3733.  So we could verbally describe the relationship as:  A state's expected pregnancy rate per 1000 girls ages 15-17 is 4.2673 plus 1.3733 for every person per 100 living in a household below the poverty line.

  <subsection>
    <title>Linear Equations and Slope</title>
    <p>
      The type of equation we looked at for poverty and teen pregnany is a linear equation, or a linear model.  Recall that the graph of a linear equation is a line.  The primary characteristic of a linear equation is that it has a constant rate of change, meaning that each time the input increases by one, the output changes by a fixed amount.  In the example above, if one state as 1 more person per 100 below the poverty line than another state, then we expect the first state to have 1.3733 more pregnancies per 1000 girls 15-17 years old.  This constant rate of change is also called slope.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
         If I were walking at a constant speed, my distance would change 6 miles in 2 hours. We could compute the slope or rate of change as
        </p>
        <me> \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 3</me>
        <p>
         In general, we can compute slope as
        </p>
        <me> \frac{\text{change of output}}{\text{change of input}}</me>
         <sidebyside widths="25% 70%">
          <p>
            In the graph shown, we can see that the graph is a line, so the equation is linear.  We can compute the slope using any two pairs of points by counting how much the input and output change, and divide them.  Notice that we get the same slope regardless of which points we use.
          </p>
          <image source="M96-L3-2-g2.jfif" width = "100%" margins="auto" valign="top"/>
        </sidebyside>
        <p>
          If the output increases as the input increases, we consider that a positive change.  If the output decreases as the input increases, that is a negative change, and the slope will be negative.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Some people call the calculation of slope <em>"rise over run"</em>, where "rise" refers to the vertical change in output, and "run" refers to the horizontal change of input.
    </p>
    <p>
      The units on slope will be a rate based on the units of the output and input variables.  It will have units of "output units per input units".  For example,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Input: hours.  Output:  miles.   Slope:  miles per hour</li>
      <li>Input: number of cats.  Output:  pounds of litter.    Slope:  pounds of litter per cat</li>
    </ul>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Slope Intercept Equation of a Line</title>
    <p>
      The slope-intercept form of a line, the most common way you'll see linear equations written, is
    </p>
    <me> y = mx + b</me>
    <p>
      where <m>m</m> is the slope, and <m>b</m> is the vertical intercept (called y intercept when the output variable is <m>y</m>).  In the equation, <m>x</m> is the input variable, and <m>y</m> is the output variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice our equation from earlier,
    </p>
    <me>T = 1.3733 \times P + 4.2673</me>
    <p>
      fits this form where the slope is 1.3733 and the vertical intercept is 4.2673.   The input variable is <m>P</m> and the output variable is <m>T</m>.
    </p>
